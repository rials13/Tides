# Tides1
#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
#### Description: 
background: When opertating commercial ships, knowledge of tides and currents is paramount for two primary reasons:
1 - Keeping the ship afloat during all operations and complying with federal, state, and company guidlines for Under Keel Clearance (UKC) - the distance between the lowest point of the ship and the seafloor.
2 - Keeping the ship alongside a dock and effectively tending mooring lines. 
the problem:
The presentation of said tide data is not easy to find. NOAA's website includes ggraphs but they are hard to see visually.  Older programs such as Nobeltec are no longer maintained with current data. Other programs such as J-tides are just wrong by about 1 foot 


It uses the NOAA Co-Op api to fetch data.

TODO: Insert highs and lows into graph.
TODO: Get a better way to store data than Localstorage.
TODO: Handle non-harmonic stations.
TODO: Do this all for currents.
